Q. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it.

A. We can reset our branch to previous specified commit and all other commits after this will be destroyed/deleted.
We can do that by hard reset method in git.
  Syntax: `git reset --hard <commit id>`
  Here commit id will be the id of commit from which we want to delete commits.
Then we can push it to remote repo by using --force flag.


There is another option to do it by switching our branch to specific commit.
  Syntax: `git switch -C branch origin/branch~n`
  Here n is the number of commits we want to remove from HEAD.
