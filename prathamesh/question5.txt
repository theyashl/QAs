Q. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

A. --force push: Force push will push all your local code to remote repository and overwrite it.
While on the other hand, Force with lease option will first check if our local code is overwriting remote code,
if yes, then the push will be rejected and if not then the push will succeed.
Force with lease assures to not overwrite content of remote repository.

Scenarios:
  Force with lease should be used always. If other team mate commits any changes to repo and our local repo don't have those change,
  force with lease will notify us about it at the time of push. Force push will overwrite that team mate's content with ours.

  Force can be used if we want to overwrite remote repository with our code.
