Q. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit.

A. We can combine two or more commits in git using rebase and squash method.
All we have to do is rebase our repo in interactive mode with the number of commits we want to merge.
Then change the opened file to squash the previous commits into one. Then we can change commit message for merged commits.

If we want to combine C2 and C3 the steps are as follows:
  We are on commit C4 (HEAD) now.
  run `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
    Here we used 2 because we have combine 2 previous commits than our HEAD.
  Then a text file will open. Change `pick` word to squash from second occurrence of pick.
  Save and Close the file.
  Another file will open, edit the commit message there and close the file.
  If we want to push our commits, we'll have to use `-f` flag. As we're erasing previous commits and making them in 1.
