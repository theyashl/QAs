Q. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.

A. We can remove staged files by removing it from staging area and cached memory.
We can do it in 2 ways.
We can remove file from staging area using command `git rm <file name> --cached`.
This will remove file from staging area but not from working directory.

Otherwise we can use git reset method to un stage the file.
We can do it by using following command: `git reset HEAD <file name>`.
It will reset our directory to last commit and will remove files from staging area.
